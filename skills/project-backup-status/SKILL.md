# Project Backup Status

## Overview

Protect the current state of a repo before significant work and make sure decisions are grounded in the project's actual status tracker. Prefer a local `backups/` folder inside the repo and a canonical TODO/status file such as `docs/TODO.md` or `TODO.md`.

## Workflow

## 1. Read Status First

Before making or planning changes, look for the project's source of truth in this order:

- `docs/TODO.md`
- `TODO.md`
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/INDEX.md`
- `README.md`
- any explicit roadmap or tracker the user points to

If a TODO exists, use it to understand what is complete, incomplete, or intentionally deferred. Update it after meaningful work.

## 2. Create the Backup Folder if Needed

Prefer a repo-local `backups/` folder.

If it does not exist, create it before archiving anything.

## 3. Create a Timestamped Backup

Use a timestamped archive name:

- `<repo-name>-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.zip`

Default archive scope:

- include source, docs, config, and project files
- exclude large reproducible or recursive paths unless the user explicitly wants a full mirror

Default exclusions:

- `node_modules`
- `dist`
- `build`
- `.next`
- `coverage`
- `.git`
- `backups`

If the repo is tiny or the user explicitly wants everything, include more. State the assumption after the backup is created.

## 4. Prefer Native Archiving Tools

Use the current environment's native tooling.

Examples:

- PowerShell: `Compress-Archive`
- Unix-like shells: `tar`, `zip`, or equivalent

Use a single command flow where practical and avoid destructive file operations.

## 5. Report the Snapshot Clearly

After the backup completes, report:

- the backup path
- the backup name
- any exclusions or assumptions
- the status source you used

## 6. Keep Status Awareness Through the Task

When continuing work after the backup:

- align next steps with the status tracker
- avoid creating a separate tracker if one already exists
- update the TODO/status file after meaningful progress
- mark only verified work as complete

## 7. Use This as the Default Safety Pattern

When the user gives broad ownership of a repo, or asks for major feature work, refactors, or risky changes, prefer this pattern:

1. inspect status
2. create timestamped backup
3. proceed with implementation
4. update status tracker

## 8. Automated backup script

A bundled automation script is provided at `scripts/backup.ps1` (PowerShell):

```powershell
.\scripts\backup.ps1 -RepoPath ".\" -BackupDir "backups" -Exclude node_modules,dist,build,.next,coverage,.git
```

Options:
- `-RepoPath` — project root (required)
- `-BackupDir` — relative path for backups (default: `backups`)
- `-Exclude` — array of directories to exclude
- `-DryRun` — preview what would be backed up without creating the archive

To use this as a project-local tool, copy it to your project's `.ai_scripts/` directory:

```powershell
cp <skill-path>/project-backup-status/scripts/backup.ps1 .ai_scripts/
.ai_scripts\backup.ps1 -RepoPath "." -BackupDir "backups"
```

- **anti-premature-termination** — Backing up is a prerequisite before risky work.

- **audit-project** — Audit should check backup status as part of project health.

- **toolchain-fallback** — Backups safeguard state before toolchain detection/install steps.
