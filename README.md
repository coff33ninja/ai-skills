# AI Skills — Cross-Tool Sync Hub

Central repository for AI agent skill definitions. Edit skills here, then push to all AI tools with one command.

## Usage

```powershell
# Sync SKILL.md files to all tool skill paths
.\sync-skills.ps1

# Preview without copying
.\sync-skills.ps1 -DryRun

# Sync skills AND generate rule/instruction files for tools with custom formats
.\sync-skills.ps1 -ConvertRules
```

## What it does

### Phase 1 — Sync SKILL.md directories

Copies skill folders into every AI tool's skill path. Overwrites existing copies to keep everything in sync.

| Tool | Global path | Project path (C:\Cleaning) |
|---|---|---|
| Universal / OpenCode | `~\.agents\skills` | — |
| Claude Code | `~\.claude\skills` | `\.claude\skills` |
| Codex CLI | `~\.codex\skills` | `\.codex\skills` |
| GitHub Copilot | `~\.copilot\skills` | `\.github\skills` |
| Cursor IDE | `~\.cursor\skills` | `\.cursor\skills` |
| Gemini CLI | `~\.gemini\skills` | `\.gemini\skills` |
| Antigravity | `~\.gemini\antigravity\skills` | — |
| Kiro | `~\.kiro\skills` | `\.kiro\skills` |
| Windsurf | `~\.codeium\windsurf\skills` | `\.windsurf\skills` |

### Phase 2 — Convert to rules/instructions (`-ConvertRules`)

Generates tool-specific rule and instruction files from SKILL.md content:

| Tool | Format | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Codex CLI** | `AGENTS.md` | `~\.codex\AGENTS.md` + `C:\Cleaning\AGENTS.md` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `copilot-instructions.md` | `C:\Cleaning\.github\copilot-instructions.md` |
| **Cursor IDE** | `.mdc` rules (one per skill) | `C:\Cleaning\.cursor\rules\skill-*.mdc` |
| **Windsurf** | `.md` rules (one per skill) | `C:\Cleaning\.windsurf\rules\skill-*.md` |

## Workflow

1. Add/edit a `SKILL.md` in `skills\<name>\`
2. Run `.\sync-skills.ps1` (or `.\sync-skills.ps1 -ConvertRules` for rules too)
3. All AI tools pick it up on next launch

## Skill Format

Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Semantic trigger for AI tools to auto-load this skill
---
```

The `name` and `description` are the primary match keys tools use to decide when to load a skill. Optional resource directories (`scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`) are bundled alongside and loaded on demand.

## Skill Catalog

| Skill | Description | Scripts | Assets | Refs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **anti-cascade-collapse** | Prevents order-gap hallucination — re-verifies assumptions at each step to avoid cascade failure | | | |
| **anti-global-install** | Never installs tools globally; uses project-local environments (venv, node_modules, etc.) | | | |
| **anti-library-hallucination** | Prevents suggesting non-existent packages, fabricated libs, typosquatting risks | | | |
| **anti-phantom-symbols** | Prevents invented APIs, imports, methods — verifies symbols against actual codebase | | | |
| **anti-premature-termination** | Enforces explicit completion criteria, verification steps before declaring done | | | |
| **anti-rogue-actions** | Prevents absurd/destructive outcomes; enforces bounds, permissions, sanity checks | | | |
| **anti-sycophancy** | Prevents compensatory sycophancy, fix loops — hard resets after 2+ failed corrections | | | |
| **anti-tool-sprawl** | Prevents over-tooling, spam, bloat; lean selection + progress detection | | | |
| **break-repetitive-patterns** | Detects repetitive questions; breaks trained logic with proactive alternatives | | | |
| **playwright** | Browser automation: navigation, forms, screenshots, data extraction via CLI | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **project-backup-status** | Timestamped backups + repo status check before risky edits | | | |
| **requirements-clarify** | Structured Q&A before ambiguous tasks — one question at a time, multiple choice, assumption surfacing, confirmation step | | | |
| **code-collaborate-qa** | Code-focused Q&A for code review, bug diagnosis, and implementation suggestions — developer intent, reproduction steps, trade-offs, confirmation gate | | | |
| **safe-code-modifications** | Never removes imports/items without verifying usage across modules | | | |
| **screenshot** | Cross-platform desktop screenshot capture (macOS/Linux/Windows) | ✅ | ✅ | |
| **security-best-practices** | Language/framework security reviews and secure-by-default coding | | | ✅ |
| **security-ownership-map** | Git-based security ownership topology, bus factor, CSV/JSON export | ✅ | | ✅ |
| **security-threat-model** | Repository-grounded threat modeling with mitigations | | | ✅ |
| **todo-bootstrap** | Creates/refreshes Markdown TODO checklists grounded in actual codebase | | | |
| **universal-format-lint** | Formatter + lint-fixer per file type (Python, JS/TS, Markdown, YAML, PS1, sh) | | | |
| **unused-import-implementation** | Infers intent and implements missing use instead of deleting unused imports | | | |
| **verify-and-cite** | Reduces hallucinations via verification, sourcing, uncertainty expression | | | |
| **yeet** | Stage, commit, push, and open a draft PR in one flow via `gh` | | ✅ | |

## ⚠️ The Fine Print — Read or Regret

### Skills are hit-and-run

These skills are loaded **when the AI deems them relevant**, not every time. Context windows are finite. If your agent is deep in a 100k-token session debugging a memory leak, it may not also load the anti-hallucination skill — even if you're hallucinating. This is called a **context miss**, and it's a feature of every tool, not a bug. Re-prompt if needed.

### Did the AI actually register them?

Some agents silently skip skills. Some say they loaded them but didn't. The only way to know is to **ask directly**. If you're unsure whether the AI is following these guardrails, say:

> *"List every skill you have registered and whether each one is active right now."*

If it can't name them, they're not loaded. Prompt again, or check the skill files exist in your tool's skills directory.

### Why these skills exist

This repository was born from **blood, sweat, and hallucinations** — watching AI agents confidently fabricate library names, invent API endpoints, install packages globally, declare tasks complete without doing them, and spiral into sycophantic agreement loops. Each `anti-*` skill here exists because a real production incident made it necessary.

Not all agents play nice. Not all skills stick. But when they *do* load, they save hours of debugging garbage output.
